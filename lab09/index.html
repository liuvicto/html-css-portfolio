	<h1>Why Kumon</h1>	
	
	<p><a href="https://www.kumon.com/" target="_blank">https://www.kumon.com/</a></p>

	<p>Kumon is an educational network in Japan which uses his "Kumon" Method to teach mathematics and reading primarily for young students.</p>
	
	<p>Kumon Students progress independently through a carefully crafted, daily worksheet-based math and/or reading curriculum. Regardless of their age, students move at their own pace, which means many children end up studying far beyond their school grade level.</p>
